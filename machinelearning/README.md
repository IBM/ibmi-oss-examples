# ML on IBM i
## Intro
  This project is used to demonstrate the capacity of IBM i platform on ML/AI area. I encounge you to use, share or even add more sub-projects/notebook to this repo.  Any comments , suggestions or advisors are welcome. Thanks.

## How to setup your environment of ML on IBM i
+ Here's where we can  [setup RPM](http://ibm.biz/ibmi-rpms
) env on i. 
+ After setting up the RPM env on i, the following packages need to installed using yum: `yum install <package name>`. A [detailed instruction](https://www.ibmsystemsmag.com/IT-Strategy/11/2019/How-to-Start-ml-on-IBM-i?utm_content=105130364&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-488711278
) is also available.

## Contents of this repo.
- **dbconn/loadcsv2db2.py**: this is a tool to import your data from csv to Db2 on i. Of course, in most cases your data is already in Db2.  NOTE, this script is using the non-journal database.
- **dbconn/runsql.py**: this is a tool of python which lets you run a sql command through command line.
- **homeCredit**: this is based on one kernel of a real data science competition on kaggle: [homeCredit]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk). The kernel used is : [start-here-a-gentle-introduction](https://www.kaggle.com/willkoehrsen/start-here-a-gentle-introduction). While the most difference from it is that we tried to use data in Db2 as the source instead of csv stream file. This notebook would help you to understand how data can be retrieved from Db2 and used in a normal data science project. 
- **sklearnDemos**: this folder stores some sklearn demos which run well on IBM i platform.
- **matplotlibDemos**: this folder stores some matplotlib demos which run well on IBM i platform.
