 *  $ composer development-disable

 *  $ composer development-status
 *
 * DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE.
 *
 * Provide your own development-mode settings by editing the file
 * `config/autoload/development.local.php.dist`.
 *
 * Because this file is aggregated last, it simply ensures:
 *
 * - The `debug` flag is _enabled_.
